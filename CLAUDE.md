### Analysis Summary

# User Component Analysis

The **User** component, located under [src/context/user/](src/context/user/), is a core domain within the application's DDD (Domain-Driven Design) structure. It encapsulates all logic and data related to user entities, their properties, and the operations that can be performed on them.

## Architecture Overview

The **User** component adheres to a layered architecture, typical in DDD, separating concerns into:
*   **Domain Layer**: Defines the core business logic, entities, value objects, and interfaces.
*   **Application Layer**: Orchestrates domain objects to fulfill use cases.
*   **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides concrete implementations for interfaces defined in the domain layer, handling external concerns like persistence or external services.

### Component Structure

The **User** component is organized into the following sub-directories:
*   [application/](src/context/user/application/): Contains application services or use cases that coordinate domain objects to perform specific tasks.
*   [domain/](src/context/user/domain/): Houses the fundamental building blocks of the User domain, including the **User** entity, its properties, and the **UserRepository** interface.
*   [infrastructure/](src/context/user/infrastructure/): Intended for concrete implementations of domain interfaces, though currently empty in the provided structure.

## Domain Layer

The **domain** layer ([src/context/user/domain/](src/context/user/domain/)) is the heart of the **User** component, defining what a User is and what operations can be performed on it.

### User Entity

The **User** entity ([src/context/user/domain/User.ts](src/context/user/domain/User.ts)) represents a user in the system. It extends the generic [Entity](src/context/shared/domain/Entity.ts) class, providing common entity functionalities like identity comparison.

*   **Purpose**: To encapsulate the state and behavior of a user within the domain.
*   **Internal Parts**:
    *   `id`: A unique identifier for the user, typically a [Uuid](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/uuid/Uuid.ts).
    *   `email`: The user's email address, represented by an [EmailValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/email/EmailValueObject.ts).
    *   `password`: The user's password, represented by a [StringValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/string/StringValueObject.ts).
    *   `createdAt`: The timestamp when the user was created, a [DateValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/date/DateValueObject.ts).
    *   `updatedAt`: The timestamp when the user was last updated, a [DateValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/date/DateValueObject.ts).
*   **External Relationships**:
    *   Relies on [UserProps](src/context/user/domain/UserProps.ts) for its properties.
    *   Implements [ToPrimitives](src/context/shared/domain/ToPrimitives.ts) to convert its state to a primitive object ([UserPrimitives](src/context/user/domain/UserPrimitives.ts)).
    *   Uses various [ValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/ValueObject.ts) types from the shared domain for its attributes (e.g., [Uuid](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/uuid/Uuid.ts), [EmailValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/email/EmailValueObject.ts), [StringValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/string/StringValueObject.ts), [DateValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/date/DateValueObject.ts)).

### User Properties

The [UserProps](src/context/user/domain/UserProps.ts) interface defines the structure of the properties required to create or represent a **User** entity.

*   **Purpose**: To provide a clear contract for the data that constitutes a User.
*   **Internal Parts**: Defines `id`, `email`, `password`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` as properties.
*   **External Relationships**: Used by the [User](src/context/user/domain/User.ts) entity for its internal state.

### User Primitives

The [UserPrimitives](src/context/user/domain/UserPrimitives.ts) type defines the primitive representation of a **User** entity, suitable for data transfer objects (DTOs) or persistence.

*   **Purpose**: To provide a plain object representation of the User entity's data.
*   **Internal Parts**: Defines `id`, `email`, `password`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` as primitive types (string, number).
*   **External Relationships**: The [User](src/context/user/domain/User.ts) entity can be converted to this primitive type via its `toPrimitives()` method.

### User Repository Interface

The [UserRepository](src/context/user/domain/UserRepository.ts) defines the contract for data persistence operations related to the **User** entity.

*   **Purpose**: To abstract the details of data storage and retrieval for User entities, adhering to the Repository pattern.
*   **Internal Parts**: Defines methods such as `save(user: User): Promise<void>` and `match(email: EmailValueObject): Promise<User | null>`.
*   **External Relationships**:
    *   Depends on the [User](src/context/user/domain/User.ts) entity and [EmailValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/email/EmailValueObject.ts).
    *   Implementations of this interface would reside in the [infrastructure/](src/context/user/infrastructure/) layer.

## Application Layer

The **application** layer ([src/context/user/application/](src/context/user/application/)) contains application services that orchestrate domain objects to perform specific use cases.

### User Match Service

The [UserMatch](src/context/user/application/UserMatch.ts) service is responsible for finding a user by their email address.

*   **Purpose**: To provide a use case for retrieving a user based on their email, typically for authentication or user lookup.
*   **Internal Parts**:
    *   Constructor takes a [UserRepository](src/context/user/domain/UserRepository.ts) dependency.
    *   `run(email: string): Promise<User | null>` method that takes a string email, converts it to an [EmailValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/email/EmailValueObject.ts), and uses the repository to find the user.
*   **External Relationships**:
    *   Depends on the [UserRepository](src/context/user/domain/UserRepository.ts) interface.
    *   Uses [EmailValueObject](src/context/shared/domain/value-object/email/EmailValueObject.ts) for email validation.
    *   Returns a [User](src/context/user/domain/User.ts) entity or `null`.

### User Save Service

The [UserSave](src/context/user/application/UserSave.ts) service is responsible for creating or updating a user.

*   **Purpose**: To provide a use case for persisting a user entity to the data store.
*   **Internal Parts**:
    *   Constructor takes a [UserRepository](src/context/user/domain/UserRepository.ts) dependency.
    *   `run(user: User): Promise<void>` method that takes a [User](src/context/user/domain/User.ts) entity and uses the repository to save it.
*   **External Relationships**:
    *   Depends on the [UserRepository](src/context/user/domain/UserRepository.ts) interface.
    *   Accepts a [User](src/context/user/domain/User.ts) entity as input.

## Infrastructure Layer

The [infrastructure/](src/context/user/infrastructure/) directory is currently empty. This layer would typically contain the concrete implementations of the [UserRepository](src/context/user/domain/UserRepository.ts) interface, connecting the domain logic to a specific database or persistence mechanism (e.g., a MongoDB repository, a PostgreSQL repository).

## Responsibilities Summary

*   **Domain Layer**: Defines the core business rules and data structures for the User. It is independent of any specific technology.
*   **Application Layer**: Orchestrates the domain objects to perform specific user-related actions (e.g., matching a user, saving a user). It acts as an API for the domain.
*   **Infrastructure Layer**: (To be implemented) Provides the actual implementation details for persisting and retrieving User data, bridging the domain with external systems.
